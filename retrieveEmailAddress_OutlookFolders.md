This script will parse through all emails in a particular folder in OUTLOOK.
It can be modified to search through the folder and extract all text/pattern matches using REGEX.
In this example it's looking for unique email addresses inside email message body in a folder called 'Test'.
OUTLOOK needs to be running, and this needs to be ran as a NORMAL user, not admin/elevated.
