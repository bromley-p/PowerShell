This script will check for the existence of pre-definied Admin groups on the system, and remove them if found.
Useful for groups being pushed out via GPO every xx minutes, and then LOGS the changes to log file.
You can set this to run on a Task Scheduler, once / twice per hour in order to remove once GPO updates. :)
